Okay, let me try the first one. Social media can help you stay connected with friends. However, it can be a major distraction from homework.

Perfect! You used "However" to show the contrast between staying connected and being distracted. That's exactly right! The word "however" helps readers understand that these are two different sides of the same topic.

Ready for the next one? Try connecting the sentences about studying and passing the exam using a cause/effect transition.

Excellent! "Therefore" is a great choice here - it clearly shows that studying caused you to pass. You're getting the hang of this!

Now try the third one about exercise. This time use an "adding" transition to show that exercise does both things.

Good work! "Also" works perfectly here. You could also use "additionally" or "furthermore" - they all show you're adding another benefit. Nice job!

One more practice item - connect the sentences about time management using an example transition.

Perfect! "For example" is exactly right - you're giving a specific example of the general idea. You've completed all the practice items! 🎉

Now for the final challenge: Write 3 connected sentences about a topic of your choice using at least 2 different transitions. Pick something you care about - maybe a hobby, a challenge you've faced, or something you're learning about. Take your time!

I've been learning to play guitar for the past year. At first, my fingers hurt and I couldn't make any chords sound right. However, I kept practicing every day. As a result, I can now play three of my favorite songs.
```

### Message 11: Assistant (Final Feedback)

Wow, this is really strong! Let me show you what you did well:

✅ You used "However" to show contrast (fingers hurting vs. keeping at it)
✅ You used "As a result" to show cause and effect (practicing led to improvement)
✅ Your sentences flow smoothly and tell a complete story
✅ You picked a topic you clearly care about - that makes your writing more engaging!

**What makes this work:**
- Your transitions help readers follow your thinking
- Each sentence builds on the one before it
- You show progress over time (great use of "At first" too!)

You've mastered using transitions to connect ideas! This skill will make all your writing clearer and easier to follow. Keep practicing with different transition words - the more you use them, the more natural they'll feel.

Great work today! 🎸
