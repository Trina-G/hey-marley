The word \"however\" helps readers understand that these are two different sides of the same topic.\n\nReady for the next one? Try connecting the sentences about studying and passing the exam using a cause/effect transition."

You've completed all the practice items! 🎉\n\nNow for the final challenge: Write 3 connected sentences about a topic of your choice using at least 2 different transitions. Pick something you care about - maybe a hobby, a challenge you've faced, or something you're learning about. Take your time!"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Wow, this is really strong! Let me show you what you did well:\n\n✅ You used \"However\" to show contrast (fingers hurting vs. keeping at it)\n✅ You used \"As a result\" to show cause and effect (practicing led to improvement)\n✅ Your sentences flow smoothly and tell a complete story\n✅ You picked a topic you clearly care about - that makes your writing more engaging!\n\n**What makes this work:**\n- Your transitions help readers follow your thinking\n- Each sentence builds on the one before it\n- You show progress over time (great use of \"At first\" too!)\n\nYou've mastered using transitions to connect ideas! This skill will make all your writing clearer and easier to follow. Keep practicing with different transition words - the more you use them, the more natural they'll feel.\n\nGreat work today! 🎸"
