## Student Persona 3: Maya (Creative, Advanced Level)

### Screen 2: Lifestyle Question
**What do you like to do when you're not in school?**
```
I love cooking and trying new recipes! I also draw sometimes and watch cooking shows with my mom. On weekends I like baking desserts and bringing them to school for my friends to try.
```

### Screen 3: Mindset Question
**How do you feel about writing?**
```
I actually enjoy writing, especially creative writing and personal essays. Academic writing can be challenging because I have to follow specific formats, but I like expressing my ideas. Sometimes I overthink things and take forever to finish though.
```

### Screen 4: Scenario Selection
**Selected:** 🍕 Kitchen Disaster

### Screen 5: Exercise 1 - Show How You Feel
```
Smoke fills the kitchen and the smoke alarm starts screaming. I wave a towel frantically at the ceiling while staring at what was supposed to be a soufflé but now looks more like a science experiment gone wrong. My mom is going to kill me when she sees the oven.
```

### Screen 6: Exercise 2 - Build a Paragraph
```
I decided to cook this fancy French dish because I wanted to challenge myself and impress my family. I've been watching cooking shows for years, and I thought it was time to try something more advanced than cookies. My mom's birthday is tomorrow, and I wanted to surprise her with something special she's never had before. Even though it didn't turn out perfect, I learned that cooking is about trying new things, making mistakes, and having fun in the process. Maybe next time I'll stick to something simpler, or at least read the recipe more carefully.
```

### Screen 7: Exercise 3 - Hook Your Reader
```
The smoke alarm went off at exactly 6:47 PM, three minutes before my mom was supposed to come home. I stood in front of the oven, watching what was supposed to be an elegant French soufflé collapse into something that looked like it belonged in a garbage disposal. This was not how I planned to celebrate her birthday.

## Student Persona 5: Chris (Enthusiastic Gamer, Detailed)

### Screen 2: Lifestyle Question
**What do you like to do when you're not in school?**
```
I'm really into gaming - mostly RPGs and strategy games like Elden Ring and Civilization. I also watch a lot of gaming streams on Twitch and sometimes make my own videos for YouTube even though nobody really watches them lol. I'm part of an online gaming group and we play together most nights.
```

### Screen 3: Mindset Question
**How do you feel about writing?**
```
Writing is alright when it's about stuff I care about. I can write forever about game strategies or explaining how to beat a boss, but school essays are rough. I get good ideas but organizing them is hard and teachers always say I need better structure.
```

### Screen 4: Scenario Selection
**Selected:** 🎮 Boss Fight Victory

### Screen 5: Exercise 1 - Show How You Feel
```
My hands grip the controller so tight my knuckles turn white. The boss's health bar is almost empty - just a sliver of red left. I stop breathing as I dodge the final attack and press the buttons for my ultimate combo. Time slows down. This is the moment I've been grinding for all week.
```

### Screen 6: Exercise 2 - Build a Paragraph
```
Beating this boss means more to me than most people would understand. I've spent literally 40 hours trying to defeat this thing, learning every attack pattern and trying different strategies. My gaming group said I should just skip it and come back later, but I hate giving up on challenges. Finally winning proves that I can stick with something hard instead of quitting when it gets frustrating. Plus now I get the legendary weapon drop which makes the rest of the game way easier. But honestly, the best part is just knowing I did something most players can't do.
```

### Screen 7: Exercise 3 - Hook Your Reader
```
The screen flashed "VICTORY" in gold letters, and I threw my controller in the air with a yell that probably woke up my neighbors. After three weeks of daily attempts, countless deaths, and more rage quits than I want to admit, I finally beat the Eternal Guardian - the boss that 78% of players never defeat. My hands were still shaking from adrenaline as I watched my character claim the legendary drop.
```

## Student Persona 6: Priya (Kitchen Enthusiast, Moderate Level)

### Screen 2: Lifestyle Question
**What do you like to do when you're not in school?**
```
I love cooking with my family! We make Indian food mostly but I also like trying random TikTok recipes. I'm also on the volleyball team and I read a lot of manga.
```

### Screen 3: Mindset Question
**How do you feel about writing?**
```
Writing is fine for the most part. I'm good at describing things but my paragraphs sometimes get messy. My teacher says I have good ideas but need to organize better.
```

### Screen 4: Scenario Selection
**Selected:** 🍕 Kitchen Disaster

### Screen 5: Exercise 1 - Show How You Feel
```
Smoke is everywhere and I'm coughing and waving my hands around trying to clear it. The pan is making a weird hissing sound and I'm pretty sure I just burned whatever was in there. I can hear my brother laughing from the other room and my face gets hot with embarrassment.
```

### Screen 6: Exercise 2 - Build a Paragraph
```
I tried to make pasta carbonara because it looked easy on TikTok but it definitely wasn't. I wanted to surprise my parents by making dinner for once since they're always cooking for me. The recipe said it only takes 20 minutes so I thought it would be simple. Everything was going fine until I added the eggs and they turned into scrambled eggs instead of a creamy sauce. I ended up ordering pizza but at least I tried something new. Next time I'll watch the video more carefully before I start.
```

### Screen 7: Exercise 3 - Hook Your Reader
```
"Why does it smell like something died?" my brother yelled from upstairs. I stared at the pan of what was supposed to be pasta carbonara but looked more like cheesy scrambled eggs with noodles. This was not going to impress my parents like I planned.
```
